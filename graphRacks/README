I have developed a plugin to be able to display a graphic rendering of the
racks.

The attachment contains two directories that you can place inside the "plugins"
directory: a directory (graphRacks) for the plugin itself plus a "commodity"
directory (rackimg) to produce and store the rack graphics (images are also
loaded into the DB, but this directory works as a cache for html).

If you want to try the plugin, after putting the code in place, try the
following:
1. create a new tag called "Front image" (Configuration -> Tag tree -> Edit
   tree, put the name in "tag name" field, "assignable" must be "yes" then click
   the button at the end of the row)
2. load the images for each object in your racks (Files -> Manage -> set the tag
   "Front image" -> choose and load the file)
3. associate each object with the desired image (for each object, go to the
   "Files" tab, and link the image; the images used must have the "Front image"
   tag set or will be ignored)
4. activate the plugin (Plugins -> Edit -> click on "+" to the right of the
   "Graph Racks" plugin line)
5. run the "graphRacks(0,0)" function from the plugin; you can associate this
   with a button somewhere but I prefer to run it daily from crontab so that you
   do not depend on people remembering to update the graphics after each change:
   put this content in a file (I saved a "crontabGraphicUpdate.php" in "inc"
   directory):
<?php
$script_mode = TRUE;
include ('init.php');
graphRacks(0, 1);
?>
and schedule its execution in crontab, for example:
30 5 * * * /usr/bin/php [racktables_path]/inc/crontabGraphics.php >/tmp/crontabGraphics.log 2>&1

After a correct execution, you can find rack graphics via RT interface here:
a. Rackspace -> select a row -> tab "Graphics" for all the racks of the selected
   row
b. Rackspace -> select a rack -> tab "Graphics" (but also in tab "View") for the
   single rack
